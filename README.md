Use Pre-trained Image Classifier to identify dog breeds

A short summary of pre-trained image classifier results are available in compiled_summary.txt 
generated by running the script compile_summary.sh. 
Detailed output of the pre-trained image classifier is part of resnet_pet-images.txt, alexnet_pet-images.txt and vgg_pet-images.txt.

Based on the results, model VGG offers the best classification of pet images into dogs and non-dogs
and into correct dog breeds 93.33% accurately. 
Although the run time is longest when using model VGG (35 seconds to classify 40 pet images), its a good trade off for higher accuracy.
